# CarHud_2.4_Update2

Required to work properly:
* Give the sender or standalone device notification access to the CarHUD app, without this Google Maps will NOT work
* Pair the 2 devices via Bluetooth if using 2 devices and set up the sender/receiver in the CarHUD settings

What works:
* Google Maps navigation thanks to a library that can grab images from notifications. Thanks to this [Library by Keith Yokoma](https://github.com/KeithYokoma/RemoteViewsReader) .
  * This includes the ETA, next turn, next turn icon, and distance to next turn
* Speedometer should work fine whether from the device's GPS or an OBDII but I only have the ability to use GPS.
* Music and artist still sends from the original source

Feel free to modify and change it to your wishes, whether that means bringing back some parts of the original HUD such as messages or
adjusting the UI For your uses.
